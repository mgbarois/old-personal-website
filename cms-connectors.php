		<p class="subtitle">Content management systems (CMS) have been getting pretty darn good at handling the technical and logistic side of multilingual websites. But to have a multilingual website, you need multilingual content, and translating this content can be a long and complex process. At least until now… Enter CMS connectors: a handy technology and great solution for <b>simplifying and streamlining your translations</b>.</p>

		<p>With just a couple clicks in your CMS platform, you can <b>easily manage your website’s translations on the fly</b>. This is looking more and more like the future of web content translation, so if you’re dreaming about creating a kick-ass multilingual website – or are in the process of doing so – listen up!</p>

		<h2>So wait, how exactly does a CMS connector work?</h2>

		<p>Ok, bear with me through all the abbreviations: When you set up a connector, it links your CMS platform to your language service provider’s (LSP) translation management system (TMS). It also creates a nice little interface inside your CMS where you can manage and keep tabs on all your translations. So, without leaving the comfort of your own CMS, you can:</p> 

		<ol>
			<li>1. <b>Select</b> any content you want translated, and into which languages</li>
			<li>2. <b>Send</b> that content directly to your translation provider</li>
			<li>3. <b>Track</b> the progress and status of the translations</li>
			<li>4. <b>Get</b> them sent back and tucked in exactly where you want them</li>
			<li>5. <b>Review</b> and publish</li>
		</ol>

		<p>And all at the click of a handful of buttons. Literally. It’s like 5 buttons.</p>
		
		<h2>Ok that’s pretty cool. But is it really going to make my life easier?</h2> 

		<p>YES. Let me break it down:</p>

		<h3>It’s faster and saves money in the long run</h3>
		<p>A more traditional way of translating a website would be to export its contents into a bunch of files, send those files to your LSP, wait, get the translations back, and re-import them into your website. Ugh. Using a connector <b>cuts out all those export, import, file transfer, and (god forbid) copy-paste steps</b>. That means no more emails, no more zip files, no more ginormous file trees. Hallelujah.This saves a whole lot of time and pointless manual work and, as we all know, time = money.</p>

		<h3>Everything is in one place</h3>
		<p>You know your CMS, you’re comfortable and competent with it’s UI, so it makes more sense to just keep everything in there. You definitely don’t want to have to break your focus to go export some files, rummage through a file tree, or e-mail your LSP to ask about the status of your translations. You’ll be more productive if <b>everything is incorporated in the same place</b> you do most of your daily work.</p> 

		<h3>It’s adapted to the changing nature of web content</h3>
		<p>Remember that traditional translation process we talked about two sections up? Export files, send files, re-import files? Ok, it’s slow, but it still sort of works, right? Now what happens if a section of one of those files changes next month?</p>  

		<p>One of the cool things about websites, compared to print media, is that they’re dynamic. Whether it’s blog posts, event info, or a new page/section, content gets added and updated all the time. Here, the old system just doesn’t cut it, and we need to call on something called agile translation: continuous translation done in short, regular bursts, rather than heavy, long, fixed-duration projects.</p>  

		<p>CMS connectors are much better <b>adapted to agile translation</b>. You can ask for translations of specific sections of content at any time, and your LSP will return them to you in the same staggered way that you submitted them.</p> 

		<h3>You can review your content exactly as it would look in its final form</h3>
		<p>Most kinds of professional translation software strip files of any non-textual content (images, layout, design). This way, the translator can focus on the source and target texts in a clean side-by-side editor. Most of the time, the LSP also does its quality checks in this purely textual format.</p>  

		<p>But what if some of the text was accidentally skipped because of a file compatibility issue? Or what if a piece of source text says “Click on the icon to the right”, but was translated literally into Arabic, and the icon is actually on the left? Or what if a button only has space for 5 characters, but has been translated into German as “Schliessen”, so the button now only reads “Schli”?</p>   

		<p>Things like this are tricky to spot until it’s too late, and by then the flub is online for the whole world to see. By integrating translation management into your CMS, as soon as your translation is sent back to you, you can immediately <b>preview what your content would look like in its published form</b>. This in-context review step can help you catch any embarrassing mistakes or problems before you hit that Publish button.</p>  

		<h2>I’m sold. How do I get this for my website?</h2>

		<h3>I have an awesome idea for a website</h3>
		<p>Once you’re ready to get your idea off the ground, <b>choose your CMS wisely</b> There are so many options out there and so many factors to consider. But if multilingualism is a priority for you, make sure that the platform you choose includes solid multilingual support and translation workflow integration. It’s always good to start off on the right foot.</p>  

		<h3>I have an awesome website, and want to go multilingual</h3>
		<p>Check your CMS’s compatibility with different connectors on the market, there are LOTS out there. Then <b>find an LSP that knows their stuff</b> when it comes to connectors and has a capable TMS.</p>  

		<h3>I have an awesome multilingual website, but want to streamline my translations</h3>
		<p><b>Ask your translation provider</b> about this possibility; they may already have a CMS integration solution to propose. If not, talk about setting one up. Chances are they’d be happy to take on this challenge with you.</p>  

		<p>And if you’re not the one who calls the shots for this kind of thing in your company: spread the word, do some research, draw up some slides, and present the idea to your management.</p>  

		<p>There are always bound to be people who drag their feet and cling to their trusty battle-weathered systems. But staying up to date with the latest industry developments is key to succeeding in today’s digital world – a world that is becoming more multilingual by the day!</p> 

		<p>More and more companies are using CMS connectors because it just makes sense. It seems that the days of exporting, importing and shuffling around files are ending. And I, for one, am not going to cry about it.</p>
